It is yet unknown what will happen if you do not acquiesce to its gutless cowardice...</p>

				<p>During the battle against the void-corrupted Madeline in the bowels of Dun'Morach, Alton High-Hill was granted an unexpected communion with his god Milil, the Lord of All Songs. The troubadour god imparted upon him the knowledge of the fluidity of fate—how his story, as well as those of his companions, had been inexplicably changed by forces beyond the mortal realm. However, the god urged Alton to embrace this new story, to make it one truly worth telling, and granted him this sword as a boon to assist to that endeavor.</p>

The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, at which your Armor Class is returned to its previous value and the weapon loses any attack and damage bonuses.</p>

				<p><i>"Dawn brings about new beginnings, new life, new chances. But what is a brilliant dawn without the dusk it must sweep away? It is a beautiful dance done by two."</i></p>
				<p><i> ~ The Ballad of Dusk and Dawn</i></p> 
			</div>
			<p>This pair of weapons count as a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. The gilded mithral edge, stemming from the inscribed bone handle of Dawn glimmers like morning sun reflecting off clear water, and sings warmly as it splits the air. Its partner Dusk, crafted of obsidian steel, cuts with naught a whisper, and its blade is perpetually wreathed in wisps of shadow.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, and you gain the effects of the <i>Two-Weapon Fighting</i> style while wielding both at the same time.</p>
			<h5><u>The Duet of Dawn and Dusk</u></h5>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p><i>“For long time you lived alone in shadow, finally it is time to dance in the rays of the light, in a deadly dance meant for two.”</i></p> 
			</div>
			<p>When you would invoke the magic of your Bladesong while wielding both of these rapiers at the same time, you can choose to reduce your maximum Hit Point total by any amount to invoke the “The Duet of Dusk and Dawn”. Infused with your own lifeforce, Dawn glows with a bright flash and Fairtale, the servant to Lathander, appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet. Wielding a copy of Dawn and Dusk held in opposite hands to your own, he has a number of Hit Points equal to the number by which you reduced your own Hit Point maximum, and all his other attributes, saving throws, movement speed, and AC mirror your own at the time of his summoning. Fairtale is an ally to you and your companions, and in combat he shares your initiative count and takes his turn simultaneously with yours. He obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, he takes the Dodge action and uses his movement to avoid danger. The Duet lasts until your Bladesong ends, Fairtale is reduced to 0 Hit Points, or he moves more than 20 feet away from you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fairtale himself can not directly attack, but grants Advantage to any attack rolls you make with Dawn and Dusk against creatures within 5 feet of himself. Additionally, he can take one of the following actions on his turn:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Blinding Flourish.</i></b> When you make an attack against a creature within 5 feet of Fairtale, he will mirror the strikes. He does no damage, but can force the target to make a DC15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s eyes are shrouded in shadow until the start of your next turn, during which their range of vision is reduced to 20 feet and they have Disadvantage on ranged attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks. A creature with Blindsight or Truesight is unaffected by this ability.</li>
					<li><b><i>Growing Shadows.</i></b> If you do not deal damage to an enemy on your turn, Fairtale imbues your blades with radiant light. Until the end of your next turn, the next successful attack you make deals an additional 4d6 Radiant damage.</li>
				</ul>
			<h5><u>Curtain's Call</u></h5>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p><i>““He fell once before, but it wasn’t the end. Everyone, yes everyone, should get a second chance”</i></p> 
			</div>
			<p>If you or an allied creature you can see would drop to 0 Hit Points while the Duet of Dawn and Dusk is active, Fairtale can sacrifice his ethereal form to save them from such a fate. In a flash of brilliant sunlight, the target regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice Fairtale's current Hit Point maximum, and can immediately move up to their Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks. Doing so ends the current Bladesong, and you cannot perform the Duet of Dusk and Dawn again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

Upon being clasped around the neck of a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be polymorphed into a dog.

As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the amulet. If you fail to complete the knight's quest before the next dawn, you will be stricken with a dire consequence. Removing the amulet once you have received a quest will also constitute a failure.</p>

			<p>This simple cloak is made from light blue satin and embroidered with motifs of clouds and steam. While you are attuned to the cloak, you can use it to cast the <i>Misty Step</i> spell. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the cloak. Whenever you cast the <i>Misty Step</i> spell through it, all gear and armor is left behind at the original location except for the cloak, which will hopefully serve to hide your now unmistakable indecency.</p>

			<p><b><i>Curse.</i></b> These boots are cursed. Attuning to them transfers the curse to you until you are targeted by a <i>Remove Curse</i> spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the boots.

This fine must be paid within 7 days' time to a representative of the Fae Court (which will appear when called). Failure to pay the fine within the alloted time, or any attempt to destroy or deface the debtor's receipt, will result in a serious consequence of the Fae Seat of Celerity's choosing.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This well-stitched velvet bag was a gift of good will from Quinn, the enigmatic tiefling betrothed to the Company of Heroes' guildmaster Gorven, as a sign of their newfound partnership with the mercantile syndicate known only as Mammazon. When in need of material components for a spell, you can whisper its name into the bag and it will appear inside in the next 1d12 minutes. Once you have placed the component's monetary value—plus a convenience fee of 10%—into the bag, the component can be withdrawn and used for whatever magical mayhem you wish to sow.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, convenience is not without its limits. If you use the bag more than three times before completing a long rest, the convenience fee will rise steeply with each subsequent item procured. Mammazon is nothing if not a shrewd businessman, after all.</p>

			<p class="indent">At night or when its wearer wills it, the earthen canvas alights into a gentle night sky full of stars. Prominently featured are three constellations, that of an Archer, a Chalice, with a Dragon motif wrapped around the shoulders. The hood also possesses a tiny astral elephant, constantly strolling across the cloth surface. The glow acts as 5 feet of dim light or 10 feet if fully illuminated.</p>

			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>A claw-marked leaf-shaped pendant, edged with polished darkwood and dangling from a sturdy leather strap. It once belonged to the wild druid Kars, the last member of a reclusive druidic order which lived in seclusion to pursue their affinity for bestial transformations. Following his death a century prior, however, his spirit continued to linger within the grove, and was eventually corrupted by the growing influence of Faust. The dracolich's power transformed him into a twisted arboreal monstrosity consumed by hatred and enmity, and he began to siphon the very essence of the land in order to fuel the creation of an army of mindless undead. However, before his vengeful crusade could spread, he was cut down and vanquished by a passing band of adventurers, and this pendant was all that could be found of the unfortunate druid.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Once per day while holding or wearing this pendant, you can cast the <i>Tree Stride</i> spell. Once the pendant has been used, it can't be used to cast the spell again until the next dawn.</p>

Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the stone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. If a creature has the pendant on their person when it explodes, it has disadvantage on this save.</p>

			<p class="indent">When a creature attempts to imbue the crystal with a spell, it must make a DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the crystal accepts and stores the spell for later use, while on a failure the crystal refuses to accept the spell and the crystal crumbles to dust. However, if the check is failed by more than 5, the crystal detonates in a spray of magic-infused shrapnel. Each creature within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the crystal must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. If a creature is holding the crystal when it explodes, it has disadvantage on this save.</p> 
		<p class="indent">This specific crystal can store a single level 1 spell or below, and disintegrates to dust after a successfully stored spell is cast from it.</p>
