			<p>This potion was given to the human known as Barnacle by a servant of Ploink, the Goddess of Chaos. Its bright azure fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Upon imbibing this potion, you can breathe underwater for 1 hour. However, due to the nature of its origin, anyone who drinks this potion and was not its original recipient will cause its chaotic magic to manifest in potentially dangerous ways.</p>

As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the ring. After having spoken the command word to activate its magic, if the ring is not submerged, it gains weight rapidly, pulling the wearer back underwater. This lasts until the ring has been dry for 1d10 minutes.</p>

<!-- Weapons -->
	<element name="Rapier of Milil" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_RAPIER_OF_MILIL">
		<description>
			<p>During the battle against the void-corrupted Madeline in the bowels of Dun'Morach, Alton High-Hill was granted an unexpected communion with his god Milil, the Lord of All Songs. The troubadour god imparted upon him the knowledge of the fluidity of fate—how his story, as well as those of his companions, had been inexplicably changed by forces beyond the mortal realm. However, the god urged Alton to embrace this new story, to make it one truly worth telling, and granted him this sword as a boon to assist to that endeavor.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">This sword has 2 charges. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend one charge to add an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the attack. The sword regains all expended charges after completing a long rest.</p>

	<element name="Battleaxe of Mordon Grimlock" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_BATTLEAXE_OF_MORDON_GRIMLOCK">
		<description>
			<p>Found buried within the bowls of the sunken Underkeep of Dun'Morach, this finely-crafted battleaxe gleams with a golden sheen and is inset with glittering rubies.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, this weapon ignores defenses and resistances granted by rock or stone; for example, an Earth Elemental would not have resistance to this weapon's damage, and its natural Armor Class would be reduced to 10 plus its Dexterity modifier.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, the weapon has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When used to make a ranged attack, it returns to the wielder’s hand immediately after a hit, but the wielder must use a bonus action to recall it should the attack miss.</p>

	<element name="Reckless Conviction" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_RECKLESS_CONVICTION">
		<description>
			<p>While sporting no particular markings or embellishments, those of the Order of the Wardens would recognize this magical halberd as the signature weapon of Warden Riel. Known for his courageous acts of selflessness in his later years, this weapon embodies a more youthful bravado and vigor, and its blade gleams faintly when held by another of the Order.</p>
			<p class="indent">The first time you attack with this halberd on each of your turns, you can reduce your Armor Class to grant the weapon a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to the amount sacrificed, up to a maximum of +3. For example, you could reduce your Armor Class by 2 in order to gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, at which your Armor Class is returned to its previous value and the weapon loses any attack and damage bonuses.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This unique halberd is an exquisite marvel of blacksmithing. Crafted from two separate weapons—Themor's personal throwing halberd and the fabled battleaxe of King Mordon Grimlock—the blacksmith was able to retain both magical enchantments and meld them into a single, powerful weapon worthy of being wielded by a god.</p>
			<p class="indent">This magic weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Additionally, this weapon ignores defenses and resistances granted by rock or stone; for example, an Earth Elemental would not have resistance to this weapon's damage, and its natural Armor Class would be reduced to 10 plus its Dexterity modifier.</p>

<!--Wondrous Items-->
	<element name="Amulet of Canine Transformation" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_AMULET_OF_CANINE_TRANSFORMATION">
			<p>This unadorned, weathered chain sports a heavy clasp and a simple pendant depicting a canine-like creature. Upon being clasped around the neck of a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be polymorphed into a dog. The creature can repeat the save at dawn of the next day until they succeed on the saving throw. While transformed, the creature retains its mental statistics, but cannot write, speak, use weapons or items, or cast any spells. </p>
			<p class="indent">If the chain is broken or removed forcefully before the creature succeeds on its Wisdom saving throw, it takes 1d10 psychic damage before reverting to its original form.</p>

			<p>A simple silver chain adorned with a diamond-shaped pendant with a small amethyst set in the center. While attuned to the amulet, you can summon a spectral homunculus that will obey your commands and, to the best of its ability, complete simple tasks for 1 hour. Once the homunculus has been summoned, it cannot be summoned again until you finish a long rest.</p>

  	<element name="Mammazon's Grocery Bag for the Everyday Wizard" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_MAMMAZONS_BAG_FOR_THE_EVERYDAY_WIZARD">
		<description>
			<p>This well-stitched velvet bag was a gift of good will from Quinn, the enigmatic tiefling betrothed to the Company of Heroes' guildmaster Gorven, as a sign of their newfound partnership with the mercantile syndicate known only as Mammazon. When in need of material components for a spell, you can whisper its name into the bag and it will appear inside in the next 1d12 minutes. Once you have placed the component's monetary value—plus a convenience fee of 10%—into the bag, the component can be withdrawn and used for whatever magical mayhem you wish to sow.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, convenience is not without its limits. If you use the bag more than three times before completing a long rest, the convenience fee will rise steeply with each subsequent item procured. Mammazon is nothing if not a shrewd businessman, after all.</p>

	<element name="Pendant of the Grovewalker" type="Magic Item" source="Almir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_PENDANT_OF_THE_GROVEWALKER">
		<description>
			<p>A clawmarked leaf-shaped pendant, edged with polished darkwood and dangling from a sturdy leather strap. It once belonged to the wild druid Kars, the last member of a reclusive druidic order which lived in seclusion to pursue their affinity for bestial transformations. Following his death a century prior, however, his spirit continued to linger within the grove, and was eventually corrupted by the growing influence of Faust. The dracolich's power transformed him into a twisted arboreal monstrosity consumed by hatred and enmity, and he began to siphon the very essence of the land in order to fuel the creation of an army of mindless undead. However, before his vengeful crusade could spread, he was cut down and vanquished by a passing band of adventurers, and this pendant was all that could be found of the unfortunate druid.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once per day while holding or wearing this pendant, you can cast the <em>tree stride</em> spell. Once the pendant has been used, it can't be used to cast the spell again until the next dawn.</p>
