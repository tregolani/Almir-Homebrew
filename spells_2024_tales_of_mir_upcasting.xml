			<p class="indent"><b><i>Mental Alarm.</i></b> You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you’re asleep.</p>

			<p>You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.</p>
			<p class="indent">An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</i></b> The damage the phantasm can deal increases by 1d6 feet for each spell slot level above 2.</p>

			<p>You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from See Invisibility or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a level 5+ spell slot, the duration is concentration up to 1 hour, and the sensor gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you cast this spell using a level 7+ spell slot, the duration is 24 hours and no longer requires concentration. If you cast this spell using a level 9+ spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled. As an Action, you can receive sensory information from any of your sensors, or continue to move them, as long as you have access to the material component, but can only focus on one at a time.</p>

			<p>Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Flood.</b> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>
			<p class="indent">The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Part Water.</b> You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Redirect Flow.</b> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Whirlpool.</b> You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p>

			<p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>

			<p>Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting Contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a Contingency cast with Water Breathing might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p>
			<p class="indent">The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then Contingency ends.</p>

			<p>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).</p>
			<p class="indent">When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p>
			<p class="indent">Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>
			<p class="indent">A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</i></b> The otherworldly entity sends an additional loyal servant to aid you for each spell slot level above 6. The beings must still be convinced, and may require individual payment.</p>

			<p class="indent">The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door.</p>

A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>

			<p>You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature.

		<description>
			<p>You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
			<p class="indent">The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.</p>
			<p><b><i>Set the Trigger.</i></b> You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Death.</i></b> Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Discord.</i></b> Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fear.</i></b> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Pain.</i></b> Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sleep.</i></b> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Stunning.</i></b> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</i></b> If the symbol deals damage, the damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 7. If the symbol has an effect, the effect's duration doubles for each spell slot level above 7.</p>

			<p>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.</p>
			<h5>Teleportation Outcome</h5>

			</table>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Familiarity.</i></b> Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.</li>
				<li>"Linked object" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.</li>
				<li>"Very familiar" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.</li>
				<li>"Seen casually" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.</li>
				<li>"Viewed once or described" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.</li>
				<li>"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Mishap.</i></b> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Similar Area.</i></b> You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Off Target.</i></b> You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>On Target.</i></b> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</i></b> You can target two additional creatures for each spell slot level above 7.</p>

			<p>As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:</p>
			<p><b>Antipathy.</b> The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.</p>
			<p><b>Sympathy.</b> The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route.
