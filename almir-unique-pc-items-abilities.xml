			<p>A magnificent small blue gem that pulses slowly, like the ebb and flow of the tides. Upon its surface glow the tiny runes of a cryptic inscription: <i>"Is it through power we gain control? Or is it through control we gain power?”</i> It was given to Barnacle by a powerful water elemental, who ominously warned the old sorcerer that the sea would come to claim his life eventually, and offered the gem as proof of the sea's wrath and power.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tides Unleashed (Stage 1):</em></strong> When casting any water-based spell, can activate the gem to double all of the spell’s damage and effects, but with a chance (30%) for the spell to hit a random target instead. Once used, cannot be used again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

			<p>After her fateful encounter with the shadowy apparitions somehow bound to her, Morani was able to earn their trust by offering to restore them to their home within the Astral Plane. In return, they are able to grant her a semblance of control over the immaterial, allowing her to assume a visage of dreams or nightmares to influence the Material world around her.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Visage of Horror (Stage 1):</em></strong> Assume a horrific visage of nightmares; for 1 minute, can cause a single creature to have Disadvantage on all attacks that target you.</p>

			<p>While attempting to attune to a simple magical necklace, Themor Hunwut found himself brought back to the site of his kingdom's destruction, surrounded by shadowy forms and the muffled sounds of battle. Suddenly, he came upon a skeletal figure cloaked in shadow, who proceeded to challenge the human to single combat. However, Themor's skill managed to both appease and impress his sudden challenger. Introducing himself as Neun, Knight of the Realm, he then granted Themor the power to meld with the Shadow Plane, albeit briefly.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shadow Meld (Stage 1):</em></strong> As a Magic Action or Reaction, can meld with the shadows; for 1 minute, all attacks targeting you are made at Disadvantage. If an attack does hit, can choose to prematurely end the melding and reduce the damage of that attack by half. Once used in either form, cannot be used against until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

			<p>Upon arriving in Galeran, Zedan Yazkash had sought a way to reunite with his former savior and mentor, Father Riel. However, it seemed that the elder human was already aware of Zedan's presence, and arranged a secret meeting with the young paladin upon the top of the city's inner walls. After hearing of Zedan's encounter with Fae'lorin, the priest chose to bestow upon him an ancient mantle of power to aid him in his travels, and to help him choose what path his life will take.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Warden's Embrace (Stage 1):</em></strong> As a Magic Action, can choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet and cause it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier. In addition, you bestow one of the following auras upon the creature:</p>

		<description>
			<p>While wandering through the streets of Galeran, Evienne Atredeske suddenly found herself transported into the Feywilds. There she met a fairy servant of the Seelie Courts name Lily, who claimed that the half-elf ranger was meant to be an emissary of the Material Plane. Confused but intrigued, Evienne allowed the fey creature to explain, and was gifted a strange necklace, shaped like a great tree and adorned with 3 small jeweled flowers. Touching the amulet, the fey fairy channeled Fey power through it, and granted a semblance of that same power to Evienne, which manifested as a pair of antlers upon her brow, as well as a set of runic tattoos running down her face and arms. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Power of a Name (Stage 1):</em></strong> Once per day, can channel the Fey power within the amulet to ask for a creature's name. If the creature offers their name willingly, its power is captured and stored in one of the flowers on the amulet's pendant. As long as that creature's name is stored, you have Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks against the creature. Furthermore, you can cast <i>Suggestion</i> once per day against any of the creatures whose names are stored within the amulet. You can choose to release any of the names stored within the amulet at any time, but may only capture one name per day.</p>

			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>Initially, a magnificent small blue gem that pulsed slowly, like the ebb and flow of the tides. Upon its surface glowed the tiny runes of a cryptic inscription: <i>"Is it through power we gain control? Or is it through control we gain power?”</i> It was given to Barnacle by a powerful water elemental, who ominously warned the sorcerer that the sea would come to claim his life eventually, and offered the gem as proof of the sea's wrath and power.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Barnacle was then visited by the goddesses Selûne and Umberlee, who beseeched the sorcerer to aid them in stopping the oncoming destruction wrought by the void. The sorcerer was dubious, but eventually relented, offering himself as a vessel for their power. As a sign of their faith, they transformed the mysterious sapphire gem into a watery spirit resembling his disguised human form, a mirror of the dual natures of the sea and of the sorcerer himself.</p>
			</div>
			<h6><b>Spirit of the Tides</b></h6>
			<p>As a Bonus Action, you can manifest a watery spirit within 5 feet of you. Its statblock is identical to yours, with the following exceptions: its Hit Point maximum is equal to half of your Hit Point maximum, and its Speed, Resistances, and Immunities are replaced with those of a water elemental as per its statblock. It can communicate with you telepathically, and can move up to its Speed as part of your movement action. The clone has two forms:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Watery Clone.</b> The spirit takes the form of Barnacle, your humanoid alter-ego. In this form, it can interact with surrounding objects as well as communicate with other creatures using any languages you know. Additionally, once on each of your turns, it can use its action to cast any of your cantrips, originating from the spirit’s location. Upon hitting a creature with the spell or a creature failing its saving throw against it, you can apply your Curse of the Sea feature to that target as if you had affected it with your own spell. This special action can be used as part of your own action just before or just after your action occurs.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Watery Scout.</b> The spirit takes the form of a puddle or stream of water. It has the following changes to its statblock: its Dexterity and Charisma ability scores are swapped, it gains proficiency with Acrobatics and Stealth, and it loses proficiency in Persuasion, Deception, and can no longer speak verbally. Otherwise it acts like a familiar, as per the find familiar spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Soul Link.</b> The spirit is a reflection of your own soul; any time it takes damage, it splits the damage evenly with you, after applying any of its Resistances. If it is destroyed, it dissolves into mist and cannot be resummoned until after a Long Rest.</p>

	<element name="Alton's Ring of the Faceless Ones (Awakened)" type="Magic Item" source="Tales of Mir Homebrew Collection" id="ID_ALMIR_UNIQUE_FACELESS_RING_STAGE2_ALTON">
		<description>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>A small gold band with no discernible features, this ring was given to Alton High-Hill by a member of the Faceless Ones who called herself "Whisper". The ring itself is recognizable by all within the organization, and thus will allow the wearer access to the smuggling dens throughout the kingdoms of Mir. However, this particular band also holds a set of unique enchantments specifically designed to help unlock barred doors, whether literal or figurative.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Alton's ring began to glow as a new voice spoke in his head. Identifying himself as Echo, another of the Faceless Ones, he explained the purpose of their organization: to shape the world to bring balance, whether it was by dethroning corrupt leaders, redistributing wealth, or moving goods or contraband. The mysterious man then noted that the other Faceless Ones were watching Alton's progress closely, and if he were to succeed on his current mission, he would be allowed to join their ranks, taking up the name of the seat to which his ring belongs. However, as a sign of faith, Echo unlocked some of the more potent magical powers within the ring to aid the young bard in his fast-approaching trials.</p>
			</div>
			<p><b><i>Charm of Unlocking.</i></b> As a Magic Action, can use the ring to unlock any non-magical lock or magical lock of spell level 3 or lower. Alternatively, can use the ring to cast the <i>Charm Person</i> spell. You can use either property up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>One of Many Faces Amongst None.</i></b> At the end of a Long Rest, can prepare a magical disguise within the restrictions of the spells <i>Disguise Self</i> and <i>Alter Self</i>, which resides within the ring until the next Long Rest. You can then assume this new form (no action required), which lasts until you release the form, or until dispelled by a spell such as <i>Dispel Magic</i>. This magical disguise, which does not require concentration, is tangible and holds up to physical inspection, and can replicate basic clothing and simple armor, though none of which grants any additional protection beyond your current Armor Class.</p>
			<p><b><i>Narrative Dissonance</i></b> Upon failing any ability check or saving throw, can use your Reaction to re-roll the check or saving throw with Advantage, as a smooth, sultry voice speaks in your mind: "No, no, that’s not how that happened.” The first time this special Reaction is used, you take 1d6 Necrotic damage, which ignores Resistance and Immunity. Each subsequent time you use this Reaction again before finishing a Long Rest, the total dice count of the Necrotic damage is doubled: 2d6, then 4d6, then 8d6, etc.</p>

		<description>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>After his encounter with the mind of Eris'atemor's void demon form, as well as his communion with the fragment of the void beast he defeated upon the <i>Widow's Kiss</i>, Apsinthos heads below deck to take an evening's rest. However, his sleep is disturbed as an overwhelming darkness consumes his dreams. Suddenly, strange runes and glyphs begin to circle his consciousness, and though he cannot read them, their meaning is emotively conveyed into his mind with an intimacy unlike any language he has known before. He tries to move away from the glyphs, but a voice speaks out to him through them, claiming to be the Void. He learns that the void is consumed with returning it and everything else to nothingness, and that in nothingness there is perfection. The concept intrigues the young warlock, and the void offers him the power to harness its vast inscrutable energy to meld his destiny into whatever he would want it to be. Seemingly swayed by the promise of all-encompassing equality in embracing the nothingness, Apsinthos accepts this gift. Only time will tell whether he will use it to shape his own destiny, or it will use him as a tool of the insatiable hunger of the void.</p>
				<p class="indent">Some months later, the group finds themselves preparing to take on Faust’s hordes in defense of Galeran, with Apsinthos’ mother acting as the forefront defender of the city. However, Apsinthos now carries a new complication with him: his long-lost sister Madeline, who is now suffused with the Void after her short-but-traumatic stint in its realm following her inexplicable liberation from her captivity in the Nine Hells. Knowing their mother would seek to take advantage of their connection with the Void using her patron, the Archduchess Zariel, they opt to sever their familial ties with the Queen of Hell and use the resulting eruption of raw arcana to allow Madeline to ascend to a position of quasi-deific power—an Exarch of the Void—to act as a mental shield and refining prism for her brother’s burgeoning Void powers.</p>
			</div>
			<p><b><i>Call Upon the Void.</i></b> As a Magic Action, can make a 1-3 worded command to the Void, causing it to cast a spell as chosen by the Void to fulfill the command given. This spell must be from the Cleric or Wizard spell lists, and cannot exceed the highest spell level you can cast, up to a maximum of level 5 spells. When you cast a spell in this manner, it does not expend a spell slot.</p>
			<p class="indent">Immediately when the spell is cast, you take 1d6 Necrotic damage, which ignores Resistance and Immunity. Each subsequent time this special action is used again before finishing a Short or Long Rest, the Necrotic damage increases by 1d6.</p>
			<p><b><i>From Nothing I Will Create My Own.</i></b> You can spend 1 minute attempting to decipher and harness the void energy coalescing around you, commanding it to manifest as a Minor Wish. However, doing so causes a great strain on your physical body, and the release of void energy causes you to take 4d10 Necrotic damage, which ignores Resistance and Immunity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this property, it cannot be used again for 7 days.</p>

				<p>After her fateful encounter with the shadowy apparitions somehow bound to her, Morani was able to earn their trust by offering to restore them to their home within the Astral Plane. In return, they are able to grant her a semblance of control over the immaterial, allowing her to assume a visage of dreams or nightmares to influence the Material world around her.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after the defeat of Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, one of her "passengers" found a way to manifest itself as a physical creature before her. Surprised but intrigued, Morani conversed with it to find that it desired to be part of her world while they searched for a way to return the shadows to their home on the Astral Plane, and was willing to aid her in any way it could with its new corporeal form.</p>

				<p>While attempting to attune to a simple magical necklace, Themor Hunwut found himself brought back to the site of his kingdom's destruction, surrounded by shadowy forms and the muffled sounds of battle. Suddenly, he came upon a skeletal figure cloaked in shadow, who proceeded to challenge the human to single combat. However, Themor's skill managed to both appease and impress his sudden challenger. Introducing himself as Neun, Knight of the Realm, he then granted Themor the power to meld with the Shadow Plane, albeit briefly.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Themor was again confronted by shadowy figures, denizens of the Shadow Plane. Indignant with his progress in aiding their goals, they assaulted him with shadow, attempting to bind him for their own, but Themor once again resisted their power. Relenting, the three spirits instead wrapped around him like a great suit of obsidian armor and tasked him with searching among the secretive dwarves for more answers.</p>

			<h6><b>Armor of Shadows</b></h6>
			<p>As a Magic Action, you can call upon your own shadow to encase you in armor, equivalent to Plate Armor (AC 18). While wearing this armor, you cast no shadow and have Resistance to Cold and Necrotic damage. However, if you take either Fire or Radiant damage, or are targeted by a level 3+ spell that creates light, you must make a Strength saving throw equal to 10 plus the damage taken, or 10 plus the level of the light spell. On a failed save, the armor dissipates and you cannot re-summon the armor until after a Short Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Shadow Step.</i></b> You can spend your Speed to teleport into any shadow cast by any object or creature you can see within 30 feet. You can use this property a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Shadow Nemesis.</i></b> As a Reaction when you take damage, you can encase yourself in vengeful shadows. You immediately reduce the damage taken by half and the shadows lash out against the attacker, causing them to take an equal amount as Necrotic damage. You can use this property a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>

				<p>Upon arriving in Galeran, Zedan Yazkash had sought a way to reunite with his former savior and mentor, Father Riel. However, it seemed that the elder human was already aware of Zedan's presence, and arranged a secret meeting with the young paladin upon the top of the city's inner walls. After hearing of Zedan's encounter with Fae'lorin, the priest chose to bestow upon him an ancient mantle of power to aid him in his travels, and to help him choose what path his life will take.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later upon the <i>Widow's Kiss</i> after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Zedan found himself transported to his new estate granted to him by his former mentor. Startled, he looked out the windows to see idyllic rolling plains and verdant forests dotted with peaceful wildlife. Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice, and turned to see Riel, younger, clad in plate armor covered in leaf motifs of emerald and silver, glowing with a soft verdant light, and flanked by a pair of similarly garbed men. Riel then explained that this home was granted to members of the Wardens, the guardians and protectors of life across the planes. As a sign of Zedan's willingness to take up the mantle in Riel's stead, the two armor-clad men—protectors from ages past—bestowed upon Zedan the title of "Warden of the Green", and with it the powers of its station.</p>

			<p><b><i>Aura of Light.</i></b> As a Magic Action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet. It immediately regains Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier, and begins to glow with a dim, verdant light. For the next minute, the creature regains Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier at the beginning of each of its turns, provided it starts the turn with at least 1 Hit Point. Additionally, if the affected creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points at any point during the aura's duration, it instead falls to 1 Hit Point, and the aura ends. You can use this special Action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses upon finishing a Long Rest.</p> 
			<p><b><i>Sentinel of Life</i></b> As a Bonus Action, you can designate one willing target you can see to bear the symbol of your protection. This mark lasts for 1 minute, and can be dismissed at will. You can mark a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier, spending a Bonus Action for each one. Once you have reached this limit, you can move a mark from one creature to another that you can see with a Bonus Action.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a marked creature within 30 feet of you is about to take damage, you can use your Reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it, and then take the damage instead of the marked creature. If the spot you teleport to would put you in range for a melee attack against the attacking creature, you may also make one attack against that creature as part of that Reaction.</p>
			<p><b><i>Sanctuary of the Green</i></b> By spending 10 minutes, you can summon forth a magical doorway which will act as a portal to the Sanctuary of the Green, the mystical home of the Wardens. You and any creature you designate when you create this door can enter the home as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the doorway if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the doorway is invisible. The dwelling itself can reshape itself to accommodate up to 10 creatures, with enough food and water to feed them as well. Furnishings and other objects created by this home dissipate into smoke if removed from it. When the doorway is dismissed, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>

				<p>Just before her fateful encounter with Eris'atemor, Evienne Atredeske was pulled back into the Feywilds. Her previous guide Lily was there to greet her along with a powerful dryad, who quickly stepped forth and thrust Evienne into a vision of her own past. Here she saw her childhood village burning, and more importantly, her father's merciless death at the hands of a younger but still recognizable Eris'atemor. As the vision faded, the enraged ranger swore vengeance upon the elf and implored her dryad to send her back. In response, the spirit then created a rough bow made of the very wooden sinews of her arms, and offered it to Evienne, commanding her to use the weapon to save those not yet lost to the elf's madness.</p>
				<p class="indent">However, her vengeance was left unsated as Eris'atemor fell to the combined might of her companions before she could get any answers from him. In fury, she mutilated the elf's corpse with her sword, causing some of the blood to splash across her new weapon. As the group absconded from Galeran upon the <i>Widow's Kiss</i>, the bow manifested a shadowy apparition of the elf himself, constructed from the memories within that very blood, and Evienne was finally able to gain answers from him, though they be hollow at best. As she fell to the ground in exhaustion, the dryad of the Feywilds spoke with her yet again, and granted her the powers of the "Fey Reaper" so that she might help prevent the oncoming apocalypse and save the planes from oblivion.</p>
			</div>
			<h6><b>Blood Branch</b></h6>
			<p>Infused with the fury and long memories of the Feywilds, this magical bow, made of rough tightly-corded branches resembling the wooden sinews of the dryad which bequeathed it, grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
			<p><b><i>Mark of the Fey Reaper.</i></b> You learn the <i>Fey Reaper's Mark</i> cantrip, and it counts as a Ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of Ranger spells you know.</p>
			<p class="indent">After hitting a marked target with a weapon attack, you can command the mark (no action required) to transform into ethereal thorny vines to bind the marked target, causing it to be Restrained for the duration of the spell, but removing the mark's bonus damage. On each of its turns, the target can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spellcasting DC to break free of the vines. You can transform this spell in this way a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and you regain all expended uses after finishing a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Blood of the Fallen.</i></b> Once per Long Rest, you can consume the memories of a fallen foe. As an Action, you can dip the bow into the creature's blood, which grants you a prophetic vision into the memories of the creature. If the target is a particularly powerful entity, you can gain the ability to momentarily converse with it, as if using the <i>Speak with Dead</i> spell.</p>

				• Gain temporary Hit Points equal to half of Barnacle’s maximum Hit Point total.<br/>
				• Your Strength and Charisma attribute values and save proficiencies are swapped.<br/>
				• A stone maul manifests in one of your open hands. It deals 2d6 Bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d12 Force damage on a hit (which is not doubled on a critical hit), has the Heavy and Two-handed properties, and it counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and Immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. On your turn, you may attack twice with it when using the Attack action.<br/> 
				• In this form, you cannot cast spells, but gain access to the <i>Petrifying Gaze</i> and <i>Stone's Lethargy</i> abilities.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, your Watery Defense ability is recharged, and you gain an additional use of it. However, the ability is replaced by Stone’s Lethargy for the duration of the transformation.<br/>
				• • <strong>Petrifying Gaze.</strong> Once per transformation as a Magic Action, you can channel the Gaze of Grumbar. Until the start of your next turn, any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you and is able to see your eyes must make a Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is instantly Petrified. Otherwise on a failure, the creature is Restrained as it begins to turn to stone, and must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming Petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. This Petrification lasts until removed by the <i>Greater Restoration</i> spell or other magic.<br/>
				• • <strong>Stone's Lethargy.</strong> As a Reaction upon being hit by a melee attack, you can strengthen the resilience of your rocky skin. You gain Resistance to the attack's damage, and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have Disadvantage on all attacks until the end of its next turn.<br/>

				• Upon transforming, you can choose to regain expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. You must finish a Long Rest before you can benefit from this recovery again.<br/>
				• Your Ocean Magic spells are improved. Upon casting a Ocean Magic spell, you can choose to either add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll(s) of the spell, or add half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to the DC of the spell.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, your Watery Defense is recharged, and you an additional use of it. Additionally, if you are within 30 feet of an ally when they take Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage from an attack, you can use a Reaction to expend a use of your Watery Defense in order for that ally to benefit from its effects as if it were you.<br/>
				• You gain Vulnerability to Cold and Lightning damage while in this form.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7-8</td><td><strong>Crystalline. </strong>A balance between the primordial powers of earth and water is obtained, whether by your own will or through the influence of another power you can’t be sure. Your horns transform into translucent crystalline spirals, and your skin darkens to an ebony sheen flecked with thousands of tiny sparkling geodes. While in this form, you gain the following effects:<br/>
				• You gain a bonus to your saving throws equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/>
				• You gain access to the following spells: <i>Magnify Gravity, Mirror Image, Hypnotic Pattern, Gravity Sinkhole, Temporal Shunt, Summon Celestial.</i> Each of these counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and you can cast them using an appropriate spell slot.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, you begin to surge with arcane power. You gain a number of temporary Sorcery Points equal to your Sorcerer level, which are separate from your normal pool of Sorcery Points. You can use these temporary Sorcery Points to cast any of the additional spells granted by this form by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell's level. Once this transformation ends, these temporary Sorcery Points vanish.<br/>
				• Barnacle takes on a similar appearance, but does not gain the additional spells.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9-10</td><td><strong>Unstable Fallout. </strong>Something…isn’t right. Your voice is not your own and the powers that you draw on seem to be a torrent of twisted force. Your skin seems to develop fissures and cracks, and sizzling water hisses and bubbles from these rends. While in this form, you gain the following effects:<br/>
				• Upon transforming, you must immediately make a <strong>DC 14 Constitution saving throw</strong>. On a failure, Barnacle dissolves, returning to your flask. However, if you fail the save by 5 or more, your control over Barnacle is severed, and he goes into a frenzy, directing spells and attacks randomly on his turns. If he is defeated in this state, he immediately dissolves and returns to your flask, and cannot be summoned again until you finish a Long Rest.<br/>
				• Each time you cast a level 2+ spell, you must roll on the Chaos Magic table and create the corresponding effect.<br/>
				• You gain a bonus to AC equal to half your Constitution modifier (rounded down).<br/>
				• You have a penalty to all saving throws equal to half your Constitution modifier (rounded down).</td></tr>

			<p>A small gold band with no discernible features, this ring was given to Curious Bite by a member of the Faceless Ones who called herself "Whisper". The ring itself is recognizable by all within the organization, and thus will allow the wearer access to the smuggling dens throughout the kingdoms of Mir. However, this particular band also holds a set of unique enchantments specifically designed to help unlock barred doors, whether literal or figurative.</p>
			<p><b><i>Charm of Unlocking.</i></b> As a Magic Action, can use the ring to unlock any non-magical lock or magical lock of 3rd level or lower. Alternatively, can use the ring to cast the <i>Charm Person</i> spell. You can use either property up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>One of Many Faces Amongst None.</i></b> At the end of a Long Rest, can prepare a magical disguise within the restrictions of the spells <i>Disguise Self</i> and <i>Alter Self</i>, which resides within the ring until the next Long Rest. You can then assume this new form (no action required), which lasts until you release the form, or until dispelled by a spell such as <i>Dispel Magic</i>. This magical disguise, which does not require concentration, is tangible and holds up to physical inspection, and can replicate basic clothing and simple armor, though none of which grants any additional protection beyond your current Armor Class.</p>
			<p><b><i>Twin Shadows.</i></b> When casting <i>Shadow Blade</i>, the wearer manifests not one but two swords, one in each hand. While you are holding both swords, you gain the benefits of the “Two-Weapon Fighting” fighting style for the duration of the spell. This ability can be used twice per Long Rest, after which casting <i>Shadow Blade</i> only results in one sword and does not grant the effects of the fighting style.</p>
			<p><b><i>Enhanced Vampiric Bite.</i></b> Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. Your snout turns into that of a dragon, a terrifying sight to behold. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d6+1 Piercing damage on a hit, and it counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and Immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. While you are missing half or more of your Hit Points, you have Advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite. In addition, when you attack with this bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You regain Hit Points equal to the Piercing damage dealt by the bite.</li>
				<li>You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the Piercing damage dealt by the bite.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You can empower yourself with this bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>

		<description>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>What's an artificer without her tools? What artificer wants to lug around bundle of tools, when one could suffice?</p>
				<p class="indent">Such is the guild stamped multitool passed down from her father to Hildie. Although branded and matching the same design as any other guild tool, this one was special. Orryn and his mentor before him had always tinkered with the tool, pushing its functions far beyond what a normal multitool was capable of. A crystalline matrix core acted as the heart of every multitool. Powering its functions and allowing the “creative juices” to flow…figuratively and in a sense, literally. Acting as a conduit for the magic of artificers as well, it was the most important part of the tool.</p>
				<p class="indent">The one in Hildie’s was…even more unique. Her father would tell her that the crystal itself was no ordinary thing, rather a relic of a time gone past. A mineral that to the naked eye looked like any other, but its patterns, its lattice, the very fluidity of its structure was something else entirely. It had great potential, and what he knew he imparted to Hildie. But, like any great magic or science, he was certain there was still much more to learn.</p>
			</div>
			<p><b><i>All-Purpose Tool.</i></b> This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as a Magic Action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan’s tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the Player’s Handbook for a list of artisan’s tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding this tool, you gain a +1 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Artificer spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Magic Action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don’t know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an Artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p><b><i>Blast of Ingenuity.</i></b> Experimentation, discovery, ingenuity; often the rise and fall of many inventors.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Magic Action, choose up to two spells that you can cast, and using the appropriate spell slots, infuse them into the tool’s unique core. Spells from other casters may be used as an action on their turn, using the appropriate spell slot from them. A maximum of two spells may be stored in this fashion in the core. The stored spells last 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Release!</i></b> As a Magic Action while one or more spells are infused into the tool's core, you can release the blended magic in an experimental blast of creative chance. Make an ability check using your spellcasting ability, with the DC equal to 10 plus the sum of the stored spells’ levels, to determine the effect from the table below:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Roll Total</td><td class="center">Result</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>Result > DC+5</td><td><strong>Eureka!</strong> The result mixes the two spells successfully resulting in something entirely new. The resulting spell effect can fully blend both spells with appropriate DM confirmation.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>DC+5 ≥ Result ≥ DC</td><td><strong>Success!</strong> The result is a partial blend of the two spells. Choose one spell to act as the base and add a modifier or effect from the other spell to mix into the cast.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>DC > Result ≥ DC-5</td><td><strong>Incomplete Melding.</strong> The spells fail to mix. Choose one of the two spells stored; that spell is cast alone as normal. The other spell remains stored in the core for its remaining duration.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>DC-5 > Result</td><td><strong>Unstable Reaction.</strong> The spells fail to mix, and their discordant energies cause the core to destabilize. Flip a coin: if the result is heads, the spell with the higher level is cast; if the result is tails, the spell with the lower level is cast. In the event of both spells being the same level, designate each spell as heads or tails before the coin is flipped. Then, once the spell is cast, the unused spell fizzles and is lost from the core.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Result = Natural-1</td><td><strong>Catastrophic Failure.</strong> The spells react violently and are both expelled as an explosion centered on the caster. The caster and all creatures within 5ft must make a Dexterity saving throw, with the DC being equal to 10 plus the sum of the stored spells' levels. On a failure, a target takes (1+X)d6 force damage (where X is the sum of the stored spells' levels), or half as much damage on a successful one.</td></tr>

				<p>The gods of Mir often work in mysterious ways, but none moreso than the curious, enigmatic god known only as Ploink. Those who call on her as their patron deity adamantly claim that She acts to bring balance to the entropy inherent in the world, but even they are hard-pressed to explain Her manifestations as anything other than random chaos. Still, Her devotees choose to spend their lives pursuing methods to summon forth Her influence into the world, and are willing to pass this knowledge on to those who express a desire to embody a life dedicated to chaos.</p>
				<p class="indent">For Themor, the intoxicating lure of his burgeoning godhood proved irresistible, and he found himself compelled to seek out Malays, the self-titled priestess of Ploink, to learn more of his powers. As expected, she was happy to share of her knowledge, and after a month of intense communion with the Goddess of Chaos, his control over Her manifestations had grown beyond the need for a blessed catalyst, instead enacting wonders of chaos with but a mere swing of his mighty blade. However, only time will tell whether the power to wield chaos so freely will bring balance or destruction to the world of Mir.</p>

			<p><b><i>Blade of Entropy.</i></b> Once per turn when you expend a Superiority Die, you can choose to convert it into an act of chaos.

Likewise, Her power has guided you to bring peace and restoration to those in need, wherever you meet them along your travels. However, with conflict brewing nearer with every dawn, your prayers to Eldath have seen Her willing to grant you the ability to protect those actively battling the forces of discord and suffering.</p>

				<p>It is not like the dragons to give thought to the small, the weak, those that they would either call food or servant. Even less so for one to give such a creature even a modicum of their power. Yet the one they called Faust, the one that nearly ended the world (again if stories were to be believed) was doing just that.</p>
				<p class="indent">There are old myths that he once protected the realm, that perhaps this was once something that truly set this being apart, or perhaps this is but a last laugh of a fallen foe, to throw chaos amidst his old rivals. Time will tell. In the end, the power is very much real, and it has found itself in the claws of a most unsuspecting host….but is it a power meant just for you?</p>
				<p class="indent">You can feel the power stirring within, a roaring, terrifying thing...and yet you cant seem to let it out. Maybe because you are still new, or perhaps because the sheer power of a dragon is still a bit much for the body of a kobold. But that doesn't deter you; in fact it only spurs you on. Knowledge paired with instinct is a true marvel and in your own way, you find the proper key to unlocking this growing power: potions.</p>

			<h6><b>Draconic Alchemy</b></h6>
			<p>You gain access to three new Experimental Elixir options, each based on an aspect of the draconic legacy which swells within you. As with your other elixirs, the potency of these increases with your artificer level.</p>
			<p><strong>Draconic Elixirs</strong></p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d3</td><td>Effect</td></tr>

				<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Scales.</strong> The drinker gains Resistance to one of the following damage types for 10 minutes: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison. The duration increases to 1 hour at 6th level and 8 hours at 15th level.</td></tr>

			<h6><b>Alchemical Masterwork: Apotheosis Draconis</b></h6>
			<p>You can unleash the latent draconic power within yourself through special elixirs created from one of three ingredients taken from your own body: scale, talon, or blood. As a Magic Action you can imbibe the brew, and your body changes with a roar; wings unfurl from your back, your scales crackle with elemental power, and the very presence of the dragons of old pulses around you. For the next 10 minutes, you gain the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Wings.</strong> Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Blindsight.</strong> You have Blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re Blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>
				<li><strong>Draconic Aura.</strong> When you transform, you may choose a number of friendly targets equal to your proficiency bonus within 30 feet to mark as your protected kin. For the duration of your transformation, your protected kin gain the benefits of the Draconis Elixir associated with the ingredient chosen when creating the potion while they are within 30 feet of you. If you chose Scale, the protected kin gain Resistance to two damage types instead of one.</li>
				<li><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> When you transform, and as a Bonus Action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (the DC being equal to your spellcasting DC), taking 4d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. However, those marked as protected kin are shielded from the blast and take no damage, and instead can choose to erupt with draconic power as their mark is empowered.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Scale.</i> Marked kin can choose to draw on the mark to cause an explosion of elemental devastation. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the marked kin must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The marked kin chooses the damage type from one of their two granted Resistances, and then loses that Resistance for the rest of the transformation's duration.</li>
					<li><i>Talon.</i> Marked kin can choose to further enhance their boon, increasing the bonus damage of their next attack to 4d4 instead of 1d4. Once a marked kin uses this effect a number of times equal to half their proficiency bonus, rounded down, the kin no longer benefits from the aura's bonus damage for the remainder of the transformation.</li>
					<li><i>Blood.</i> Marked kin can choose to momentarily overwhelm those around them with draconic presence, allowing them to immediately use a Reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. Once a marked kin has used this Reaction, it cannot do so again for the remainder of your transformation.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>You can create a number of Apotheosis Draconis elixirs equal to half your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses upon completing a Long Rest. All elixirs created must be used with an hour or they become inert. If any creature besides yourself consumes an Apotheosis Draconis elixir, they do not gain any of its effects and instead suffer from the <i>Poisoned</i> condition for the next 24 hours.</p>

			<p>As a Bonus Action, roll a d20, and for 10 minutes, your body assumes the corresponding elemental form. Alternatively, you can forgo this roll and spend the listed sorcery points to force the transformation into Earth, Water, or Crystalline (your choice). While you are transformed, you are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form.</p>
			<p class="indent">You may use this boon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and regain all expended uses after finishing a Long Rest.</p>
			<table class="class-features">
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d20</td><td>Sorcery Point Cost</td><td class="left">Elemental Form</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>2-8</td><td>2</td><td class="left"><strong>Earth.</strong> Become a living avatar of Grumbar, strengthening your flesh as stone, with the bright ruby eyes to match. Barnacle dissolves during this transformation, lost to the overwhelming surge of the earth, and you gain the following effects:<br/>
				• You gain a bonus to AC equal to double your Constitution modifier.<br/>
				• Gain temporary Hit Points equal to one third of your Hit Point maximum.<br/>
				• Your Strength and Charisma attribute values and save proficiencies are swapped.<br/>
				• A +1 stone maul manifests in one of your open hands, which deals an additional 2d12 Force damage on a hit. You are proficient with this weapon, and can spend 1 Sorcery Point to activate its Mastery property. On your turn, you may attack twice with it when using the Attack action.<br/> 
				• In this form, you cannot cast spells, but gain access to the following abilities:<br/>
				• • <strong>Petrifying Gaze.</strong> Once per transformation as a Magic Action, you can channel the Gaze of Grumbar. Until the start of your next turn, any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you and is able to see your eyes must make a Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is instantly <i>Petrified</i>. Otherwise on a failure, the creature is <i>Restrained</i> as it begins to turn to stone, and must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming <i>Petrified</i> on a failure or ending the effect on a success. This Petrification lasts until removed by the <i>Greater Restoration</i> spell or other magic.<br/>
				• • <strong>Stone's Lethargy.</strong> As a Reaction upon being hit by a melee attack, you can strengthen the resilience of your rocky skin. You gain Resistance to the attack's damage, and you have Resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. In addition, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have Disadvantage on all attacks until the end of its next turn.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, your Watery Defense ability is recharged, and you gain an additional use of it. However, the ability is replaced by Stone’s Lethargy for the duration of the transformation.<br/>
				• While transformed, any ability requiring a saving throw uses the following DC calculation: <strong>Stone Form DC</strong> = <i>8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</i></td></tr>
				<tr><td>9-15</td><td>2</td><td class="left"><strong>Water. </strong>You embrace the tides of Umberlee: your form becomes fluid and mutable, and light seems to glint and refract as it strikes your skin. Refreshed and invigorated by the tides, a new storm is brought forth. While in this form, you gain the following effects:<br/>
				• Upon transforming, you can choose to regain expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. You must finish a Long Rest before you can benefit from this recovery again.<br/>
				• Your spells of the storm and sea are improved. Upon casting an Ocean Magic spell or a spell that deals Bludgeoning, Cold, or Lightning damage, you can choose to either add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell, or add half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to the DC of the spell.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, your Watery Defense is recharged, and you an additional use of it. Additionally, if you are within 30 feet of an ally when they take Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage from an attack, you can use a Reaction to expend a use of your Watery Defense in order for that ally to benefit from its effects as if it were you.<br/>
				• You gain Vulnerability to Cold and Lightning damage while in this form.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>16-19</td><td>3</td><td class="left"><strong>Crystalline. </strong>A balance between the primordial powers of earth and water is obtained, sustained by the burgeoning well of deific energy within you—a byproduct of the continued influence of deities upon your soul. Your horns transform into translucent crystalline spirals, and your skin darkens to an ebony sheen flecked with thousands of tiny sparkling geodes. While in this form, you gain the following benefits:<br/>
				• You gain a bonus to your saving throws equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/>
				• You gain access to the following spells: <i>Magnify Gravity, Mirror Image, Hypnotic Pattern, Gravity Sinkhole, Temporal Shunt, Arcane Hand.</i> Each of these counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and you can cast them using an appropriate spell slot.<br/>
				• Upon transforming, you begin to surge with arcane power. You gain a pool of Primordial Energy equal to your Sorcerer level, and can use these to cast any of the additional spells granted by this form by spending a number of  points equal to the spell's level. You can spend additional points to upcast any of these spells up to the maximum spell slot level you currently have. Once this transformation ends, this pool of energy vanishes.<br/>
				• If summoned, Barnacle takes on a similar appearance, but does not gain the additional spells.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>20</td><td>—</td><td class="left"><strong>Elemental Genesis. </strong> Tapping into the very weave of creation, you are transformed into a being of unrestrained primal energy. Howling winds and crashing waves swirl around you, and lightning flashes and crackles from your pulsing form of roiling steam and molten rock. While in this form, you gain the following benefits:<br/>
				• You gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed, and can hover.<br/>
				• You have Resistance to all damage except Psychic, Radiant, Necrotic, and Force. You can use your Watery Defense against any damage you take for which you have Resistance, and you do not expend its use when you do so.<br/>
				• You can teleport up to 60 feet as a Bonus Action on each of your turns.<br/>
				• The effective level of spells you cast is increased by 1.<br/> 
				• You gain access to the following abilities, which use your Sorcerer spell save DC and can be enhanced using Metamagic:<br/>
				• • <strong>Conflagration Lance.</strong> As an Action, you unleash a searing lance of magma at one creature you can see within 150 feet, which explodes in fiery shrapnel on impact. The target and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 10d8 Fire damage and starts <i>Burning</i>; on a success, it takes half as much damage and does not start <i>Burning</i>. At the end of each of its turns, a <i>Burning</i> creature repeats the saving throw, taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save, or ending the condition on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.<br/>
				• • <strong>Frigid Bore.</strong> As an Action, a roaring wave surges out from your palm in a 60-foot Cone. All creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 8d6 Cold and 8d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. In addition, any Huge or smaller creature who fails the save is pushed back 15 feet and knocked <i>Prone</i>.On their turn, they must use either their full movement or their Action to stand back to their feet.<br/>
				• • <strong>Thundercrack.</strong> As an Action, you direct a crackling bolt of lightning to strike a point you can see within 150 feet. All creatures within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failure, it takes 4d12 Thunder and 4d12 Lightning damage and is <i>Deafened</i> and <i>Blinded</i> until the end of your next turn. A creature who fails the save by more than 5 is also <i>Incapacitated</i> until the end of your next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is only <i>Deafened</i>.<br/>
				• • <strong>Crushing Fissure.</strong> As an Action, you split the ground with a mighty stomp, creating a collapsing ravine originating from you that is 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. This area is considered Difficult Terrain, and a creature can spend its Action to clear a 5-foot Cube. All creatures within the line when it appears must make a Strength saving throw; on a failure, they take 3d10 Bludgeoning and 3d10 Piercing damage and are <i>Restrained</i> by the collapsing ground for the next minute, provided they are Huge or smaller. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not <i>Restrained</i>. If a creature starts its turn while <i>Restrained</i> by this ability, it immediately takes 3d10 Bludgeoning damage, and can use its Action to attempt to free itself, making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br/>
				• While incredibly powerful, this form is also physically taxing. For every turn you start while in this form, you take 4d6 Force damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. If you are rendered Incapacitated or Unconscious while in this form, it immediately ends. You can also choose to end this form at the end of any of your turns (no action required). When the form ends, you immediately suffer 2 levels of Exhaustion, and cannot assume this form again until you finish a Long Rest.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>—</td><td class="left"><strong>Unstable Fallout. </strong>Something…isn’t right. The primordial powers of earth and storm rage within you, using your physical body as their battleground. Your skin becomes parched, splitting open in fissures and cracks as sizzling water hisses and bubbles through these rends. While in this form, you gain the following effects:<br/>
				• Your Speed is halved.<br/>
				• Each time you cast a level 2+ spell, you must roll on the Chaos Magic table and create the corresponding effect.<br/>
				• You gain a bonus to AC equal to half your Constitution modifier (rounded down).<br/>
				• You have a penalty to all saving throws equal to half your Constitution modifier (rounded down).</td></tr>
				• The sheer stress this broken form puts on your body is beyond unbearable. Your maximum hit points are reduced by twice your current level, and you immediately suffer 2 levels of Exhaustion.<br/>
				• If Barnacle is summoned when you transform, you must immediately make a <i>DC 17 Constitution saving throw</i>. On a failure, Barnacle dissolves, returning to your flask. However, if you fail the save by 5 or more, your control over Barnacle is severed and he goes into a frenzy, directing spells and attacks randomly on his turns. If he is defeated in this state, he immediately dissolves and returns to your flask, and cannot be resummoned until you finish a Long Rest.<br/>

		<description>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>After his encounter with the mind of Eris'atemor's void demon form, as well as his communion with the fragment of the void beast he defeated upon the <i>Widow's Kiss</i>, Apsinthos heads below deck to take an evening's rest. However, his sleep is disturbed as an overwhelming darkness consumes his dreams. Suddenly, strange runes and glyphs begin to circle his consciousness, and though he cannot read them, their meaning is emotively conveyed into his mind with an intimacy unlike any language he has known before. He tries to move away from the glyphs, but a voice speaks out to him through them, claiming to be the Void. He learns that the void is consumed with returning it and everything else to nothingness, and that in nothingness there is perfection. The concept intrigues the young warlock, and the void offers him the power to harness its vast inscrutable energy to meld his destiny into whatever he would want it to be. Seemingly swayed by the promise of all-encompassing equality in embracing the nothingness, Apsinthos accepts this gift. Only time will tell whether he will use it to shape his own destiny, or it will use him as a tool of the insatiable hunger of the void.</p>
				<p class="indent">Some months later, the group finds themselves preparing to take on Faust’s hordes in defense of Galeran, with Apsinthos’ mother acting as the forefront defender of the city. However, Apsinthos now carries a new complication with him: his long-lost sister Madeline, who is now suffused with the Void after her short-but-traumatic stint in its realm following her inexplicable liberation from her captivity in the Nine Hells. Knowing their mother would seek to take advantage of their connection with the Void using her patron, the Archduchess Zariel, they opt to sever their familial ties with the Queen of Hell and use the resulting eruption of raw arcana to allow Madeline to ascend to a position of quasi-deific power—an Exarch of the Void—to act as a mental shield and refining prism for her brother’s burgeoning Void powers.</p>
				<p class="indent">However, in the wake of the Third Age's crimson end at the hands of the moon goddess Selûne, Apsinthos finds his burgeoning aptitude with the Void thrust into upheaval. Despite Madeline's ability to channel the Void more accurately to his desires, the process of pulling from the Void has grown increasingly more dangerous, with each act sapping his vitality far greater than ever before. While it is unclear whether stopping Selûne will revert the Void's grip on his soul, Apsinthos must soldier on as he can, instead channeling the Void into more esoteric manifestations to empower his companions and hinder his enemies.</p>
			</div>
			<p><b><i>Call Upon the Void.</i></b> As a Magic Action, can make a 1-3 worded command to the Void, causing it to cast a spell as chosen by the Void to fulfill the command given. This spell must be from the Cleric or Wizard spell lists, and cannot exceed the highest spell level you can cast, up to a maximum of level 5 spells. When you cast a spell in this manner, it does not expend a spell slot.</p>
			<p class="indent">The first time you cast a spell in this manner, you suffer no adverse effects. If you cast another level 2+ spell with this feature before you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d4 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell immediately after you cast it, and your Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each time you use this feature again, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d4. Finishing a Short or Long rest resets the Necrotic damage you take for each spell level back to 1d4.</p>
			<p><b><i>Telepathic Transcendence.</i></b> When you use a Bonus Action to form a telepathic bond with a creature, you can either guard its mind against esoteric intrusions or assault it with crippling waves of psychic energy.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Mind Shield.</i></b> The creature has Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws (choose one when bonding) and Resistance to Psychic damage. If that creature fails a saving throw of the type you are protecting, you can use a Reaction to give them a bonus to that roll equal to your Charisma modifier, potentially turning the failure into a success.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Scatter Senses.</i></b> You force the creature to make an Intelligence Saving Throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has Disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws (you choose when bonding), Vulnerability to Psychic damage, and Disadvantage on attack rolls against one creature of your choice as pain and spasms wrack its nerves. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the Intelligence saving throw, ending your telepathic bond on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Rend Psyche.</i></b> You force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has Disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws (you choose when bonding), Vulnerability to Psychic damage, and Disadvantage on Constitution saves to maintain Concentration as nightmares cloud its mind. If the creature attempts to cast a spell, there is a 50% chance the spell fails as a result of your intrusive presence in its thoughts. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the Intelligence saving throw, ending your telepathic bond on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>From Nothing I Will Create My Own.</i></b> You can spend 1 minute attempting to decipher and harness the void energy coalescing around you, commanding it to manifest as a powerful Void Wish.</p>
			<p class="indent">The stress of commanding the Void to manifest in a great work of transcendental magic is both physically and mentally exhausting. Immediately after enacting the Void Wish, roll all of your hit dice (these are not expended). You take Necrotic damage equal to the total rolled, which cannot be reduced in any way, and your Hit Point maximum is reduced by the same amount. In addition, you gain two levels of Exhaustion, which last for 7 days and cannot be removed by any means except by the <i>Wish</i> spell. The reduction to your Hit Point maximum persists as long as you still have these levels of Exhaustion, but diminishes by 10 after each Long Rest you complete during this 7-day period.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this ability, it cannot be used again for 7 days.</p>

If you cast another level 2+ spell with this feature before you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d4 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell immediately after you cast it, and your Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity. &#13;
			Each time you use this feature again to cast a level 2+ spell, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d4. Finishing a Short or Long rest resets the Necrotic damage you take for each spell level back to 1d4.</description>

In addition, you gain two levels of Exhaustion, which last for 7 days and cannot be removed by any means except by the <i>Wish</i> spell.

				<p>After her fateful encounter with the shadowy apparitions somehow bound to her, Morani was able to earn their trust by offering to restore them to their home within the Astral Plane. In return, they are able to grant her a semblance of control over the immaterial, allowing her to assume a visage of dreams or nightmares to influence the Material world around her.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after the defeat of Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, one of her "passengers" found a way to manifest itself as a physical creature before her. Surprised but intrigued, Morani conversed with it to find that it desired to be part of her world while they searched for a way to return the shadows to their home on the Astral Plane, and was willing to aid her in any way it could with its new corporeal form.</p>

			<p><b><i>Astral Visage</i></b> You can harness the raw arcane power of your astral companions in order to disrupt the actions of those around you. As a Magic Action, you can assume one of the following magical forms:</p>

				<li><em>Nightmare Form:</em> Assume a horrific visage of nightmares. Choose one creature you can see; for the next minute, it has Disadvantage on all attacks against you.</li>
				<li><em>Dream Form:</em> Assume a shifting, mirage-like visage. Choose one creature you can see; for the next minute, you have Advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks against it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You can assume your visage up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Astral Familiar.</i></b> Your astral companion can now manifest as a familiar, assuming any animal form of your choosing. All other abilities are defined in the <i>Astral Familiar</i> cantrip, which you always have prepared.</p>
			<p><b><i>Arcane Dissonance.</i></b> The innate magical energies of your familiar can be harnessed in order to disrupt the spellcasting of another. As a special Reaction while your Astral Familiar is summoned, you can cast <i>Counterspell</i> at level 3 without expending a spell slot. However, doing so causes you to take 1d10 Force damage, which ignores any and all Resistance or Immunity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Using this ability taxes the metaphysical form of your astral familiar. The first time you use this Reaction after finishing a Long Rest, you cast Counterspell as normal.

			<p><b><i>Weave Empath.</i></b> Suffused with a burgeoning connection to the Astral Plane, you can manipulate its energies more deftly when your body is aligned with its flow. When you spend a use of Wild Shape to assume your Starry Form, your abilities are heightened in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Archer.</b> You can choose to target a willing ally with your arrow, which automatically hits. Instead of taking damage, the target then gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Radiant damage the arrow would deal.</li>
				<li><b>Chalice.</b> When casting a spell or using a feature that causes a creature to regain Hit Points, if any of the dice roll its maximum value, you may roll an additional die and add that to the amount of healing received. The amount of extra dice cannot exceed the base number rolled by the spell or feature. If the spell or feature restores a static amount of Hit Points (like the Heal spell), divide that number by four and add it to the total restored.</li>
				<li><b>Dragon.</b> When you succeed on the Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half the roll’s total. If you fail the Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can deal Psychic damage to the creature who triggered the save equal to the roll’s total plus your Wisdom modifier.</li>

				<p>While attempting to attune to a simple magical necklace, Themor Hunwut found himself brought back to the site of his kingdom's destruction, surrounded by shadowy forms and the muffled sounds of battle. Suddenly, he came upon a skeletal figure cloaked in shadow, who proceeded to challenge the human to single combat. However, Themor's skill managed to both appease and impress his sudden challenger. Introducing himself as Neun, Knight of the Realm, he then granted Themor the power to meld with the Shadow Plane, albeit briefly.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later, after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Themor was again confronted by shadowy figures, denizens of the Shadow Plane. Indignant with his progress in aiding their goals, they assaulted him with shadow, attempting to bind him for their own, but Themor once again resisted their power. Relenting, the three spirits instead wrapped around him like a great suit of obsidian armor and tasked him with searching among the secretive dwarves for more answers.</p>
				<p class="indent">Over a year later, Themor joined his companions in battling the crazed realm of Vahnsinn and his manic kobold Keeper. During their lengthy battle, he felt himself compelled to gift the aberrant Aspect of Madness his final Ploink bean, and the great dragon used the bean's entropic energy to abdicate his title as an Aspect, and thus freed himself from the deific magic which kept him trapped within Chultmir's timeless nightmare. Shrinking down to the size of a housecat, the grateful wyrmling offered to enhance his already formidable powers of chaos and shadow, and the Lawbringer strode out from the southern land with even greater magicks at his disposal.</p>
			</div>
			<h6><b>Armor of Shadows</b></h6>
			<p>As a Magic Action, you can call upon your own shadow to encase you in armor, equivalent to +1 Plate Armor (AC 19). While wearing this armor, you cast no shadow and have Resistance to Cold and Necrotic damage. However, if you take either Fire or Radiant damage, or are targeted by a level 3+ spell that creates light, you must make a Strength saving throw equal to 10 plus the damage taken, or 10 plus the level of the light spell. On a failed save, the armor dissipates and you cannot re-summon the armor until after a Short Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Shadow Step.</i></b> You can spend half your movement to teleport into any shadow cast by any object or creature you can see within 30 feet. You can increase this to 60 feet if you spend all of your movement. You can use this property a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Shadow Nemesis.</i></b> As a Reaction when you take damage, you can encase yourself in vengeful shadows. You immediately reduce the damage taken by half and the shadows lash out against the attacker, causing them to take an equal amount as Necrotic damage. You can use this property a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p><b><i>Shadow Shroud.</i></b> Having been shrouded in the protective umbra of the Shadow Plane for so long, you have now learned to infuse the natural shadows of others to bolster their defenses.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Protective Shroud.</i></b> As a Bonus Action while your Shadow Armor is active, choose a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Reduce your own AC by 1, and that creature becomes shrouded in shadowy armor, granting them Half Cover for the next 10 minutes. You can maintain a protective shroud on a number of creatures equal to your Constitution modifier, spending a Bonus Action for each one. If you shroud another creature in excess of this number, you must end the protective shroud on another creature as part of the same Bonus Action. At the start of your turn, you can recall any number of these protective shrouds (no action required).</li>
				<li><b><i>Umbrous Brand.</i></b> If a creature protected by a shroud is hit by an attack from a creature within 30 feet of it, you can command the shroud to lash out, transforming into an umbrous brand on the attacking creature, which lasts for 1 hour. This brand tethers the creature’s essence to the Shadow Plane, and you may use this tether to teleport to a space within 5 feet of the creature on your turn (no action required) so long as the creature resides on the same plane as you. You have Advantage on the next attack you make against that creature, and on a hit it deals an additional 1d10 Necrotic damage. Once you teleport to a branded creature, the umbrous brand dissipates.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Once a protective shroud transforms into an umbrous brand, you cannot recall the AC you sacrificed to create it until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

		<description>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p>Upon arriving in Galeran, Zedan Yazkash had sought a way to reunite with his former savior and mentor, Father Riel. However, it seemed that the elder human was already aware of Zedan's presence, and arranged a secret meeting with the young paladin upon the top of the city's inner walls. After hearing of Zedan's encounter with Fae'lorin, the priest chose to bestow upon him an ancient mantle of power to aid him in his travels, and to help him choose what path his life will take.</p>
				<p class="indent">Later upon the <i>Widow's Kiss</i> after defeating Eris'atemor and his void-demon form, Zedan found himself transported to his new estate granted to him by his former mentor. Startled, he looked out the windows to see idyllic rolling plains and verdant forests dotted with peaceful wildlife. Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice, and turned to see Riel, younger, clad in plate armor covered in leaf motifs of emerald and silver, glowing with a soft verdant light, and flanked by a pair of similarly garbed men. Riel then explained that this home was granted to members of the Wardens, the guardians and protectors of life across the planes. As a sign of Zedan's willingness to take up the mantle in Riel's stead, the two armor-clad men—protectors from ages past—bestowed upon Zedan the title of "Warden of the Green", and with it the powers of its station.</p>
				<p class="indent">However, Zedan's journey proved more tumultuous than expected. Despite honoring his oath in service of the world to defeat Faust alongside the other Cursebreakers, he compromised his personal ethos, prioritizing some lives over others. This led his paramour Morani, as well as his oath-bound steed Shenarii, to confront and ultimately cut ties with him, leaving him alone and emotionally adrift. Seeking to rediscover himself, he dedicated himself to fervent service of life wherever he could find it—assisting struggling farming towns, sponsoring up-and-coming adventuring parties, and traversing the wide expanses of Sormir...only to be thrust back into the arms of his former companions—sans Morani—in the wake of the Third Age's crimson end at the hands of the moon goddess Selûne. With halberd in hand, Zedan embarks on yet another mission to safeguard life against forces great and small, the essence of those Wardens before him resting firmly on his shoulders.</p>

			<h6><b>Mantle of the Warden</b></h6>
			<p><b><i>Aura of Light.</i></b> As a Magic Action, choose one creature that you can see. It immediately regains Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting modifier, and begins to glow with a dim, verdant light. For the next minute, the creature regains Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier at the beginning of each of its turns, provided it starts the turn with at least 1 Hit Point. Additionally, if the affected creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points at any point during the aura's duration, it instead falls to 1 Hit Point, and the aura ends. You can use this special Action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses upon finishing a Long Rest.</p> 
			<p><b><i>Sentinel of Life.</i></b> At the start of your turn, you can choose up to two willing targets to bear the symbol of your protection. This mark lasts for 1 minute, and can be dismissed at will. You can choose two new creatures each turn, but cannot have more than two creatures marked at any one time.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a marked creature within 30 feet of you is about to take damage you can see, you can use your Reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it, and then take the damage instead of the marked creature. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way. If the spot you teleport to would put you in range for a melee attack against the attacking creature, you may also make one attack against that creature as part of that Reaction, dealing an additional 1d8 Radiant damage on a hit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you use your Reaction to teleport to an ally and take damage for them, a spectral sapling appears in the space you left. Until the start of your next turn, the sapling conveys the benefits of your Aura of Protection to allies within 10 feet of it, after which it dissipates in a swirl of leaves and pollen.</p>
			<p><b><i>Verdant Shield.</i></b> The act of protecting those you care for compels the very power of Life to come to your aid. For every 10 damage you take for another creature, your AC increases by 1 as your Warden's Mantle thickens to imitate bark, scales, or some other form of natural protection. The maximum amount of AC you can gain from this feature is equal to your Charisma modifier. This bonus lasts for the next minute, after which the mantle reverts to simple cloth.</p>
			<p><b><i>Sanctuary of the Green</i></b> By spending 10 minutes, you can summon forth a magical doorway which will act as a portal to the Sanctuary of the Green, the mystical home of the Wardens. You and any creature you designate when you create this door can enter the home as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the doorway if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the doorway is invisible. The dwelling itself can reshape itself to accommodate up to 10 creatures, with enough food and water to feed them as well. Furnishings and other objects created by this home dissipate into smoke if removed from it. When the doorway is dismissed, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>

			<p>You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have Advantage on any Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check you make to find it. Additionally, a marked target cannot benefit from any cover or impose Disadvantage due to Obscurement or line of sight as the weapons of the caster phase through the Feywilds to unerringly find their target. If the target drops to 0 Hit Points before this spell ends, you can use a Bonus Action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your astral companion can manifest as a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form of your choosing. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (or closest equivalent creature that has a challenge rating of 0), though it is a magical construct instead of a beast.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it acts on your turn, and you can use your Bonus Action to command it to make actions, but it cannot attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.</p>
			<p class="indent">While your familiar is summoned, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Magic Action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Your familiar is linked to you, and cannot move more than 100 feet from you.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Magic Action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits you summons. As a Magic Action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
